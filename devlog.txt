OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow we so BOSS bc...

We learned how to use processing throughout our journey of this project. It was very confusing at first. For example, we encountered a problem where we got the ingredients to show on the counter, but they would disappear 1 second later. Slowly, we got the gist of processing.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
blah blah pesky bug...
maybe some of these will move into the Obs.Ovrcm section...

When you click on the ingredients on the bottom, the images donâ€™t pop up very fast and the program is a little bit laggy.
The program lacks text output on the screen. We resorted to printing text in the message window instead.
The user lacks the ability to continue playing within the game. When the game is over (regardless of whether the player won or not), the window is closed and the user must press play again in order to play. 

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow! oo!...

We learned how to make a button in processing, new functions like mouseClicked and how to load images onto processing.


MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
we changed ___ to ___ bc...

Instead of having four customers at a time, we changed it to having one customer at a time for simplicity.
Instead of having the user dragged the burger to the customer, we created a button when you are done making your burger because we thought it would be easier for the user.

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
tales of wisdom gained...
