Hamburger Kart

Description

When you start up processing, you see a screen with ingredients at the bottom and a counter. Customers will come up one by one and each customer has a unique order. These customers are also ordered by their priorities which are generated randomly. You have to click on the ingredients to make a burger that matches the orders and click on a button when you are done. Once you click the button, the program checks to see if the burgers match. If they match, then the next customer comes in. If they don't match, then the burger is discarded. You have a set amount of time for the level and once time runs out, then it's game over.
