# DEADBEEF

**Tina Chen, Angel Ng, Adrian Boylan**
**Hamburger Kart**

### Description

Start up processing, and you see a screen with ingredients at the bottom and a counter. Customers will show up one by one and each customer has a unique order that is randomly generated. These customers are also ordered by their priorities, which are also generated randomly. You have to click on the ingredients to make a burger that matches the orders and click on a button when you are done. Once you click the blue button, the program checks to see if the burgers match. If they match, then the next customer comes in. If they don't match, then the burger is discarded. You have a set amount of time for the level and once time runs out, then it's game over.
